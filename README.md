**Teabot Project Documentation**
=====================================

**Overview**
------------

Teabot is a .NET-based web application that utilizes a combination of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) to provide a conversational interface for users. The project aims to create an autonomous AI agent that can break down user tasks into subtasks and provide a checklist of steps to complete.

**Project Structure**
---------------------

The project is organized into the following directories and files:

* `Agent`: Contains the core logic for the AI agent, including the `LlmAgent` class and its dependencies.
* `Properties`: Holds the `launchSettings.json` file, which configures the application's launch settings.
* `Program.cs`: The main entry point of the application, responsible for setting up the web application and services.
* `README.md`: This documentation file.

**Key Components**
-------------------

### LlmAgent

The `LlmAgent` class is the central component of the project, responsible for:

* Processing user input and generating a checklist of steps
* Updating the checklist based on user feedback
* Invoking tools and services to complete tasks

### ToolRegistry

The `ToolRegistry` class manages a collection of tools and services that can be invoked by the `LlmAgent`. It provides methods for registering, invoking, and describing tools.

### AgentState

The `AgentState` class represents the current state of the AI agent, including the checklist of tasks and the user's progress.

**Services and Dependencies**
-----------------------------

The project uses the following services and dependencies:

* `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`: For building the web application
* `Serilog`: For logging and diagnostics
* `Swashbuckle.AspNetCore`: For API documentation and Swagger UI
* `System.Text.Json`: For JSON serialization and deserialization

**Configuration**
-----------------

The project uses the `launchSettings.json` file to configure the application's launch settings, including the environment variables and application URL.

**Dockerization**
-----------------

The project includes a `Dockerfile` that defines the build process for the Docker image. The `docker-compose.yml` file configures the Docker container and network settings.

**API Endpoints**
-----------------

The project exposes the following API endpoints:

* `/health`: Returns a health check response
* `/tools/register`: Registers a new tool or service
* `/tools/describe`: Returns a description of the registered tools

**Tools and Services**
----------------------

The project includes the following tools and services:

* `Tool`: A base class for tools and services
* `ToolRegistration`: A class for registering new tools and services
* `ToolRegistry`: A class for managing the collection of tools and services

**Future Development**
----------------------

The project has the following areas for future development:

* Integrating additional tools and services
* Enhancing the NLP and ML capabilities of the AI agent
* Improving the user interface and experience

**Conclusion**
